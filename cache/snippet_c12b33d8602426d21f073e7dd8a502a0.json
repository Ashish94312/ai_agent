"Conflicting Facts:\n- Source 1 states that the Ising model undergoes a phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase in 2 dimensions.\n- Source 3 states that the ordered phase of the one-dimensional Ising model is always unstable.\n\nConsensus:\n- The Ising model undergoes a phase transition, but there may be differences in the behavior of the model depending on the dimensionality.\n\nUnified Summary:\nThe Ising model is a thermodynamic system that undergoes a phase transition. In two dimensions, the model transitions between an ordered and a disordered phase. However, in one dimension, the ordered phase of the Ising model is always unstable."
