"Conflict/Contradiction:\nThe conflict arises in the terminology used to describe solar power. Source 1 mentions that solar power uses photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, while Source 2 states that photovoltaic technology directly turns solar energy into electrical power.\n\nReasons for the contradiction:\nThe contradiction may arise due to the different ways of describing the same process. Source 1 focuses on the overall concept of solar power, mentioning the use of photovoltaic cells as one method to achieve it. Source 2, on the other hand, specifically highlights photovoltaic technology as the means to directly convert solar energy into electrical power.\n\nConcise, factual summary:\nSolar power harnesses the energy from sunlight and converts it into electricity. This is achieved through the use of photovoltaic cells or photovoltaic technology, which directly converts solar energy into electrical power."
