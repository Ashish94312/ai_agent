"Conflict/Contradiction: The conflict arises in the descriptions of what artificial intelligence refers to. Some sources describe it as the capability of computational systems to perform tasks associated with human intelligence (Sources 1 and 4), while others describe it as computer systems capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence (Source 2). Additionally, Source 3 mentions specific tasks like image analysis and speech recognition, while Source 7 mentions reasoning and decision making.\n\nPotential Reasons for Contradiction: The contradiction could be due to differences in the time of writing, as well as the specific focus or perspective of each source. Some sources may provide a broader definition of artificial intelligence, while others may focus on specific applications or capabilities.\n\nConsensus Summary: Artificial intelligence refers to the capability of computational systems or computer systems to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence. This includes tasks such as reasoning, decision making, image analysis, speech recognition, and more. The technology enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy."
