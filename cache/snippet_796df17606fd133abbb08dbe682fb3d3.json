"Conflict/Contradiction:\nThe conflict in the article summaries is regarding the definition of artificial intelligence (AI). Some sources describe AI as the capability of computational systems to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, while others focus on AI as computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Additionally, one source mentions AI as a technology that allows for image analysis and speech recognition, while another source mentions AI as the ability of a digital computer or robot to perform tasks associated with intelligent beings.\n\nPotential Reasons for Contradiction:\nThe contradiction in the article summaries could be due to different perspectives and interpretations of what artificial intelligence encompasses. It is possible that the sources were written at different times, and as AI technology evolves, the understanding and definition of AI may have changed. Additionally, the sources may have different data sources or expertise, leading to variations in their descriptions of AI.\n\nConcise, Factual Summary:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems or computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes tasks such as image analysis, speech recognition, reasoning, decision making, problem solving, creativity, and autonomy. AI is a rapidly evolving technology that is transforming various industries and enhancing productivity."
