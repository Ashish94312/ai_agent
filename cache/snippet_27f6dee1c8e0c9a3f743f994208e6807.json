It was named after physicists Ernst Ising and Wilhelm Lenz.\n\nUnified Summary:\nThe Ising model, also known as the Lenz-Ising model, is a mathematical model used to study ferromagnetism and phase transitions. It was named after physicists Ernst Ising and Wilhelm Lenz. The model assumes that local reactions can be both negative and positive. The Ising model has been successful in understanding and studying various aspects of probability and thermodynamic systems."
